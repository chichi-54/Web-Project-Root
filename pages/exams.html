        <h2>1. Why Big Exams Can Feel Challenging</h2>
        <p>
            Major exams often bring pressure, uncertainty, and the feeling of not knowing where to begin. 
            Many students worry they won’t have enough time to review everything, or they become overwhelmed 
            by the amount of material. But most exam stress comes from a lack of structure—not a lack of ability. 
            Once you create a clear plan and break the process down into manageable steps, even the biggest exams 
            become far less intimidating.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Finding What Works for You</h2>
        <p>
            Every learner is different. Some absorb information visually, others through listening, writing, or 
            hands-on practice. Before you build a study schedule, it’s important to understand which learning style 
            supports you best. When you study in a way that matches how your brain naturally processes information, 
            you retain more in less time and feel more confident.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not sure what your learning style is? Explore different methods on our 
            <a href="../pages/study-skills.html">Study Skills page</a> to discover personalized strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use Your Learning Style to Create a Strong Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Once you know how you learn best, you can build a study plan that actually works. Break large units into 
            smaller sections, set daily goals, and review regularly instead of cramming. Use flashcards for memorization, 
            videos for visual concepts, or practice questions for applied learning—whatever supports your learning style. 
            With a consistent plan, you’ll feel prepared long before test day arrives.
