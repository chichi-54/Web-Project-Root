        <h1>Finding the Right College</h1>
        <p>Finding the right college is a multi-stage journey that involves understanding your own identity, researching institutional options, and navigating complex application timelines. The process is most successful when students focus on college fit, which is the degree to which an institution meets their academic, social, and financial needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="fit-match">
        <h2>Understanding Fit and Match</h2>
        <p>While the terms are often used interchangeably, they represent two different perspectives of the admissions process. College fit focuses on the student’s requirements, such as location, class size, support services, and specific academic programs. Conversely, match refers to whether the student meets the college’s prerequisites, such as high school GPA and test scores. Students who attend a college with academic indicators below their own ability are said to "undermatch", a common occurrence among high-achieving, low-income students who may lack support during the choice process. Finding a school that fits social and financial needs significantly increases the likelihood of a student completing their degree.</p>

    <section class="institution-types">
        <h2>Comparing Institutional Types</h2>
        <p>Deciding between public, private, and community colleges is a critical step in the search process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Universities:</strong> Funded by state governments with lower in-state tuition. Larger campuses, diverse academic offerings, vibrant student life, but larger classes and competition for courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Universities:</strong> Funded by tuition and donations. Higher sticker price, but often generous merit aid and smaller class sizes for personalized attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Colleges:</strong> Affordable pathways with flexible scheduling, online and night classes. Many students transfer to four-year universities for continued education.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="financial-aid">
        <h2>Financial Aid and Support</h2>
        <p>Financial aid is split into <strong>merit-based</strong> (achievements/talent) and <strong>need-based</strong> (FAFSA determined) aid. Grants and scholarships do not need repayment. Work-study allows students to earn money through on-campus employment. First-generation students should seek specialized resources like the Sagan Academic Resource Center or Summer Bridge Programs to navigate college transitions.</p>

    <section class="analogy">
        <h2>Analogy for Understanding Fit</h2>
        <p>Think of the college search like buying a pair of running shoes. The "match" is the size—if the shoe doesn't meet your basic requirements (GPA, test scores), it won't fit. The "fit" is how the shoe feels when you run: is it supportive enough (academic needs), does it match your style (social life), and is it within budget (financial aid)? Just as the most expensive shoe isn’t always the most comfortable, the most prestigious college isn't always the best choice.</p>
