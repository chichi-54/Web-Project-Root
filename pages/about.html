        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Many students graduate with strong academic knowledge but lack real‑world
            experience. Our goal is to close that gap by emphasizing career readiness as a
            critical part of education.

            <h2>What Is Career Readiness?</h2>
            <p>
                Career readiness includes communication, teamwork, adaptability, and
                problem‑solving — all essential for thriving in modern workplaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                It prepares individuals to understand expectations, manage responsibilities,
                and present themselves professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Digital literacy, time management, and lifelong learning are also key
                components that help students remain adaptable in a changing world.

            Professionalism and employability skills help students make positive impressions,

            technologies, and professional challenges.
