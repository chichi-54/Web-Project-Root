    <!-- ================= QUESTION CARDS ================= -->
    <section class="qna-container" id="qnaContainer">

        <!-- CATEGORY: Career Direction -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-blue">Career Direction</span>
            <h3 class="question">I'm a junior and I have no idea what I want to do after graduation. Is that bad?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Not at all — most juniors feel exactly the same! Start by taking career interest surveys such as Myers‑Briggs or
                Holland Code. Pay attention to activities and classes that make you lose track of time. Try volunteering,
                job shadowing, or talking with teachers about careers that match your strengths. You don’t need to have
                everything figured out — just start exploring.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: Resumes -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-green">Resumes</span>
            <h3 class="question">My resume is empty because I've never had a job. What do I put?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                You have more experience than you think! Include volunteer work, school clubs, tutoring, babysitting,
                skills, awards, and leadership roles. Employers look for responsibility, communication, and willingness to
                learn — not just work history.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: College Options -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-yellow">College Options</span>
            <h3 class="question">Do I need to go to college to get a good career?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Not always. Trades (electrician, welder, HVAC) pay very well and don’t require a 4‑year degree. Tech
                bootcamps, apprenticeships, and healthcare certificate programs are solid options, too. College helps for
                careers like teaching or engineering, but you should choose the path that fits your goals and learning
                style.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: Interview Tips -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-orange">Interview Skills</span>
            <h3 class="question">I bombed my first interview. How do I not freeze next time?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Practice is key! Rehearse common questions aloud with a friend. Prepare examples of teamwork and
                problem‑solving. Research the company beforehand and bring questions to ask them. Interviewers expect
                nervousness — it gets easier each time!
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: Internships -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-purple">Internships</span>
            <h3 class="question">What’s the difference between an internship and a job?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Internships are temporary learning experiences, while jobs are long‑term employment. Internships often
                lead to better job opportunities because you gain skills, references, and professional connections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: Networking -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-red">Networking</span>
            <h3 class="question">How do I network if I don’t know anyone in my field?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Start with teachers, counselors, and family friends. Create a LinkedIn profile and connect with alumni
                from your school. Attend career fairs and send short “informational interview” emails. Most professionals
                are happy to help students.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CATEGORY: Social Media -->
        <div class="qna-card">
            <span class="category cat-gray">Digital Presence</span>
            <h3 class="question">Should I include my social media on my resume? Do employers check?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Only include LinkedIn. Employers do check — over 70% review candidates’ social media. Make your accounts
                private, remove inappropriate posts, and clean up usernames. Your digital footprint matters!
